# Tier-2 integration tests

Hits real dev Supabase. Verifies the v2 domain RPCs end-to-end:
round-trip (response ↔ cloud row), idempotent replay, and atomicity
(tenant guard + validation).

Files live under `test/integration/rpcs/`. The harness skips itself
automatically when env vars are absent, so leaving these files in the
default `flutter test` run does no harm.

## One-time setup (≈10 minutes)

These tests need a dedicated test user + business on your **dev**
Supabase project. Don't point them at production.

1. **Create the auth user.** In Supabase Studio → Authentication → Users
   → Add user → email like `test+sync@example.com`. Copy the new user's
   id (the `auth.users.id`) — you'll use it as `auth.uid()` in the next
   step.

2. **Bootstrap business + profile + staff user.** In the SQL editor,
   signed in as `service_role`:

   ```sql
   -- one-time test fixture
   DO $$
   DECLARE
     v_auth_uid     uuid := '<paste auth.users.id from step 1>';
     v_business_id  uuid := gen_random_uuid();
     v_user_id      uuid := gen_random_uuid();
   BEGIN
     INSERT INTO public.businesses (id, owner_id, onboarding_complete, name)
       VALUES (v_business_id, v_auth_uid, true, 'Sync Tests');

     INSERT INTO public.profiles (id, business_id, name, role, role_tier)
       VALUES (v_auth_uid, v_business_id, 'Test User', 'ceo', 5);

     INSERT INTO public.users (id, business_id, auth_user_id, name, role, pin)
       VALUES (v_user_id, v_business_id, v_auth_uid, 'Test User', 'admin', '0000');

     RAISE NOTICE 'TEST_BUSINESS_ID=%', v_business_id;
     RAISE NOTICE 'TEST_USER_ID=%', v_user_id;
   END $$;
   ```

   Copy the two ids printed in the NOTICE messages.

3. **Sign in once and capture the refresh token.** Easiest path: a
   one-line dart script run with `dart run`, or just paste this snippet
   into a scratch test that prints the token:

   ```dart
   final c = SupabaseClient('<dev url>', '<dev anon key>');
   await c.auth.signInWithOtp(email: 'test+sync@example.com');
   // …complete the magic link in the inbox, then in a fresh session:
   final res = await c.auth.verifyOTP(
     email: 'test+sync@example.com',
     token: '<the OTP code>',
     type: OtpType.email,
   );
   print('TEST_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN=${res.session?.refreshToken}');
   ```

   Refresh tokens last ~30 days by default. When tests start failing on
   `setSession`, repeat this step and update the env var.

4. **Persist the env vars.** Put them in a `direnv` `.envrc` (or any
   shell-startup file) so `flutter test` sees them:

   ```sh
   export TEST_SUPABASE_URL='https://<your-project>.supabase.co'
   export TEST_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY='eyJ...'
   export TEST_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY='eyJ...'
   export TEST_USER_REFRESH_TOKEN='<from step 3>'
   export TEST_BUSINESS_ID='<from step 2>'
   export TEST_USER_ID='<from step 2>'
   ```

   `.envrc` is gitignored — never commit secrets.

## Running

```sh
# Tier 1 only (no env vars needed) — runs in <5s, every PR:
flutter test test/sync/dispatch/

# Tier 2 — needs the env vars above; ~10–20s including network:
flutter test test/integration/

# Both tiers:
flutter test
```

The Tier-2 files are tagged `@Tags(['integration'])` so a CI workflow
can opt them out with `--exclude-tags integration` if needed.

## Known limitations

- **Manual refresh-token seeding.** Step 3 is interactive. Until
  Supabase exposes a way to mint a session from `auth.admin` in the
  Dart SDK, devs re-run it whenever the token expires. Tracked in the
  redesign plan §9.5.
- **Tests share one test business.** Each test creates rows scoped by
  unique uuids and cleans up in `tearDown`, so parallelism within a
  single run is safe. Two devs running the suite against the same
  business at the same time will see flaky cleanup races — coordinate
  or each dev seeds their own test business.
- **No nightly CI yet.** Tier 2 is dev-machine-only. A scheduled
  workflow against a dedicated test project is the obvious next step
  but isn't part of this slice.

## Adding tests for new RPCs (batches 3–10)

Per the redesign plan §9.8, every batch ships with:

- one tier-1 file under `test/sync/dispatch/<dao>_dispatch_test.dart`
- one tier-2 file under `test/integration/rpcs/<rpc>_test.dart`

Use the existing files as templates. For `pos_record_sale_v2` and
`pos_cancel_order` specifically, the tier-2 file MUST include a
mid-flight rollback test — `pos_record_sale_v2` exercises insufficient
stock partway through a multi-item sale; `pos_cancel_order` exercises a
partial-state cancel where some items have already been refunded.
