# Ribaplus POS - Project Overview

Ribaplus POS is a modern Flutter-based Point of Sale application designed specifically for drinks distributors. It features offline-first capabilities with local SQLite storage and seamless cloud synchronization.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

-   **Frontend**: Flutter (v3.10.7+)
-   **Local Database**: [Drift](https://drift.simonbinder.eu/) (SQLite)
-   **Remote Backend**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Auth, PostgreSQL, Real-time Sync)
-   **Authentication**: Removed. All auth screens (`lib/features/auth/screens/`) and widgets (`lib/features/auth/widgets/`) are deleted. `AuthService` is now a stub that returns a hardcoded CEO user. App boots directly into `MainLayout`.
-   **Printing**: ESC/POS Bluetooth Thermal Printing

## 📂 Project Structure

The project follows a feature-driven architecture for scalability and maintainability.

## 🔐 Key Patterns

-   **Sync Strategy**: Uses `SupabaseSyncService` combined with a `SyncQueue` table in Drift to handle offline operations and reliable background synchronization.
-   **Role-Based Access**: Multi-tier user roles (Staff=1, Manager=4, CEO=5) managed via `UserData` and enforced in local screens. Role restrictions on forms are deferred until auth is restored.
-   **Financials**: All currency amounts (Retail price, Selling price, Wallet balance) are stored and manipulated as **Kobo (integers)** to avoid floating-point errors.
-   **Crate Management**: Specialized logic for tracking empty crate stocks and deposits, grouped by `CrateGroups`.
-   **Add Product Form**: `lib/features/inventory/widgets/add_product_sheet.dart` — collects name, retail price, unit, color, crate size (Big/Medium/Small), manufacturer (autocomplete from existing products), supplier (autocomplete from DB). Selling price and cost price are NOT on this form — added later in product detail screen.
-   **Products schema**: `supplierId` (nullable FK → Suppliers) added in schema v14. `crateSize` stores 'big'|'medium'|'small'. No bulk/distributor price fields on add form.

## 🚀 Development Guidelines

1.  **UI/UX**: Prioritize premium aesthetics. Use `AppTheme.dark()` and `AppTheme.light()`. Avoid generic colors; use theme-defined palettes.
2.  **Linting**: Follow `analysis_options.yaml`. Ensure all code passes `flutter analyze`.
3.  **State Management**: Extensive use of `ValueNotifier` and `StatefulWidget` patterns for local state; `Drift` for persistent state.
4.  **Database Updates**: When modifying `app_database.dart`, run `dart run build_runner build` to regenerate the G-files.

## 📦 Assets
-   **Images**: Stored in `assets/images/`, including branding (Ribaplus logo) and decorative backgrounds.

## Workflow Rules

### 1. Always Plan Before Coding
- For any complex task, write a step-by-step plan first and wait for approval before writing code
- Use the format: "Here's my plan: [steps]... Should I proceed?"

### 2. Check Your Own Work
- After making changes, always run `flutter analyze` to verify no errors
- Run `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` after any schema changes

### 3. Update This File
- If you make a mistake or discover a new project convention, update CLAUDE.md immediately so it's remembered permanently

### 4. Small Focused Changes
- Make one change at a time, verify it works, then move to the next
- Never refactor unrelated code while fixing a bug

### 5. Auth is Removed — Do Not Re-introduce
- `lib/features/auth/` is fully deleted. Do not import anything from it.
- `AuthService` (`lib/shared/services/auth_service.dart`) is a stub — only import `flutter/widgets.dart` and `app_database.dart`. Do not add back `supabase_flutter`, `google_sign_in`, `shared_preferences`, `crypto`, or `drift` imports unless auth is being re-implemented intentionally.
